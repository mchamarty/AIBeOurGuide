The goal is to create a fully automated pipeline from code commit to production deployment.\n\n## Key Components\n\n### 1. Testing Framework\n- Automated unit testing with Jest\n- Integration testing with Cypress\n- Load testing with k6\n- Security scanning with SonarQube\n\n### 2. CI/CD Pipeline\n- Jenkins for pipeline orchestration\n- Docker for containerization\n- Kubernetes for container orchestration\n- ArgoCD for GitOps deployment\n\n### 3. Infrastructure as Code\n- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning\n- Ansible for configuration management\n- AWS CDK for cloud resources\n\n### 4. Monitoring and Logging\n- Prometheus for metrics\n- Grafana for visualization\n- ELK stack for log management\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n1. Phase 1: Testing Automation\n- Set up automated testing framework\n- Implement code quality gates\n- Configure security scanning\n\n2. Phase 2: Pipeline Enhancement\n- Upgrade Jenkins pipelines\n- Implement container strategy\n- Configure GitOps workflow\n\n3. Phase 3: Infrastructure Automation\n- Deploy IaC framework\n- Implement configuration management\n- Set up cloud resource automation\n\n4. Phase 4: Monitoring Implementation\n- Deploy monitoring stack\n- Configure alerting\n- Set up dashboards\n\n## Success Metrics\n- 90% test coverage\n- < 15 minutes deployment time\n- Zero manual intervention in deployments\n- 99.9% pipeline reliability"

Here's the proposed approach:\n\n```typescript\nconst client = new ApolloClient({\n  cache: new InMemoryCache({\n    typePolicies: {\n      User: {\n        fields: {\n          posts: {\n            merge: true,\n            read(existing, { args: { first = 10 } }) {\n              return existing?.slice(0, first);\n            },\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  }),\n});\n```\n\nThis should handle the new cache directives properly. Let's test this in staging first.",
